# SimpleNetwork

This repository contains two different approaches for a very simplified version of a social network api.

## Features

So far Users can create an account, log in, create, read, update and delete posts.

## installation

just navigate in the root folder of each api and run npm install
After installing all dependencies you can just run `npm start` and play around with the api.
Therefore I recommend postman for the REST-API and the GraphQL-API can be tested under http://localhost:3000/graphiql if the local development server is running.
You might notice that the GrapQL-folder is still empty.
This will change in the next few hours ;)
